ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tyrost

But my name is Christopher Daniel Corzo Mendez. Or just Daniel for simplicity :)
I was born in Mexico and I aspire to be a Machine Learning Engineer one day!
I attend the University of Oregon with a double major of Computer Science and Data Science.
Currently, I aim to maximize my understanding in Software Development to later connect it into
more complex developement ideas, such as AI.

Iâ€™m currently learning the principles of working with other developers.
Not before knowing all there is to know about full-stack developement, with a focus on back-end.
I wish to learn all those technical connections that make our world go around every day.
Exploring new languages and frameworks during my own time.

âš¡ Fun fact:

I am a gym-goer :) I love to do calisthenics mixed with standard weightlifting.
